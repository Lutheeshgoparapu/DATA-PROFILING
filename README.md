# AUTOMATED DATA PROFILING USING AI TECHNIQUES WITH ML

## ABSTRACT:
Data profiling, the methodical process of 
identifying and documenting the properties of 
data sets, is becoming more and more 
important as the market for artificial 
intelligence expands. The errors that are 
frequently found in databases can be removed 
via data profiling. These mistakes include 
values that are out of range, missing or 
incorrect and unexpected data patterns.
Data profiling can help you find potential 
knowledge opportunities and evaluate how 
well your data is being maintained if you want 
to improve the quality of your data.
